With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care.
Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.
Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).
Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations.
